#Â Smart Home UI Dashboard :house:

This is the repository of my self written _smart home_ dashboard UI.

## Tech & Stack

This dashboard is a web application, _mostly_ relies on the following:

* [`react`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
* [`redux`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
* [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
* [`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
* [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist/issues)

Check the rest of dependencies in [`package.json`](https://github.com/zilahir/smarthome/blob/master/package.json)
